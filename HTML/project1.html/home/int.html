            <p id="content">Our designs stand out because they tell a good story. To find it, we dig into the history of a location and the culture of its neighborhood. Then we do the hard part—create the twist that makes people care. By focusing on concept and story first, we set a vision that gets everyone on board and guides every other decision we make.</p>

            <p id="content">We shape the flow of our spaces by carefully locating interior walls, lighting and key design elements—like millwork, furniture and architectural finishes. We present this in a thorough design package—floor plans, reflected ceiling plans, elevations, hand sketches, design imagery—that you’ll sleep with because you love it so much.</p>

            <p>0.3<span>Design Development</span></p>
            <p id="content">Pretty pictures are great, but only if they’re buildable. We provide design intent drawings of every plan and elevation needed to build out a project, and we meet with everyone on the team to make sure they understand the design. Our design intent drawings include final floor plans, RCPs, finish plans, power and data plans, final elevations with finish, tags and dimensions, custom millwork and detail drawings, and final material specifications with schedules.</p>

            <p id="content">When construction begins, we make sure everything stays copasetic through weekly OAC meetings and site visits. We review all shop drawings, provide additional detail drawings for clarification, answer RFIs and coordinate the final FF&E installation. We stop when your interiors are everything we hoped, planned, sweated, cried and bled for.</p>
