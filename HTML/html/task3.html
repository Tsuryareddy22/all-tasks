            A <b>URL or Uniform Resource Locator</b>
            is a Unique identifier that is contained by all the resources available on the internet. It can help to locate a particular resource due to its uniqueness. It is also known as the web address. A URL consists of different parts like protocol, domain name, etc. The users can access the URLs by simply typing them inside the address bar or by clicking any button or link web page.

<center><h1>WATER FALL METHODOLOGY <h1> </center>
<p><b>The Waterfall Model</b> is a classical software development methodology. It was first introduced by Winston W. Royce in 1970. It is a linear and sequential approach to software development that consists of several phases. It must be completed in a specific order. This classical waterfall model is simple and idealistic. It was once very popular. Today, it is not that popularly used. However, it is important because most other types of software development life cycle models are a derivative of this. In this article we will see waterfall model in detail.</p>

<center><h1>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE <h1> </center>
<p> <b>Software development life cycle (SDLC)</b> is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step. The goal of the SDLC life cycle model is to deliver high-quality, maintainable software that meets the userâ€™s requirements. SDLC in software engineering models outlines the plan for each stage so that each stage of the software development model can perform its task efficiently to deliver the software at a low cost within a given time frame that meets users requirements. In this article we will see Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in detail.</p>
